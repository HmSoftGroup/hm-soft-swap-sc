DeFi back end experience needed for addition of DEX launchpad

Full Stack Development Posted Dec 21, 2021

Full-stack developer with blockchain/smart contract experience needed to complete PinkSale-like, custom token/presale launchpad that's currently being integrated with a DEX in development. Backend development experience including Dev-ops. Solidity development - developing and debugging smart contracts.

NO AGENCIES, PLEASE

Our CD3D DEX launchpad is a combo of a Dodoex.io, PancakeSwap, and Bounce.Finance-like decentralized exchange, designed to make it easy for gaming token launches, host liquidity, staking, and swap tokens. The DEX part is pretty much done (still needs to add self-service staking) but we need to build the backend while we finish front end design with our in-house designer and front-end developer. Think of it as a cross between a fork of PancakeSwap and PinkSale. It would be a self-service launchpad but with some features I see lacking in these platforms today, including a way for just a regular hosted token sale (not a presale).

This job could be a gateway to more work or an official position as CTO. If you are interested and have the availability to work on this, let's talk.

Thank you.
